# 👋 Hey, I'm [Your Name]

☕ **Java Developer** | Backend Engineer  
🚀 Spring Boot | Clean Architecture | Pragmatic Systems  

I like building **simple, robust backend systems** that scale *because they are well-designed*, not because they are over-engineered.

- 🧱 Monolith-first architecture (then evolve)
